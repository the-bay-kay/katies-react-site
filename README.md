## Katie's Personal Website

![Katie's Website Homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-bay-kay/katies-react-site/main/Website%20Preview.png)

Hey there!  My name's Katie, and this is the code for my portfolio site.  It's still in development, but I've been
working hard on making sure it's the best it can be! Here's a few highlights to get you started:

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/p0jvHn4WdEfGG7i4plu7W8/Katie's-Site?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Arz83SMvtpJQWQVl-1)
 has my design mock-up and the SVG files used!
- This webapp utilizes the [MERN Stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack)!  Specficially, I use MongoDB to store the website's blogposts.
- As of this commit (7/24/23), there are two branches: main contains the "guts" - the backend, working posts - while other branches
are being finished so they can go live early!  The goal is to have a live portfolio landing page, and then add the blog at a later date.

Thanks for checking out my site!  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at <katie.risc@gmail.com>

## React Boilerplate

![Preview of the website homepage](WebsitePreview.png)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
